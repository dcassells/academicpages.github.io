Hello. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Complexity and Computational Social Science at Sorbonne Université. While also being associated with teams at Sciences Po and LPI Cité Université in Paris.

My research interests lie at the intersection of network science, mathematical modeling, and media expertise. I am particularly focused on investigating questions related to political polarization within social platforms, and the influence of group identity. By leveraging interdisciplinary approaches, I aim to gain insights into the dynamics and mechanisms that contribute to the creation and fragmentation of online communities.

Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol is where my academic journey began - completing both my master's and undergraduate degrees there. During these studies, I spent a year in the Mathematics and Computer Science departments at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), focusing on stochastic processes, complex networks, and artificial intelligence.

Following my master's, I had the privilege of working as a senior data analyst for the *Guardian*, in London, creating insights to inform editorial strategies and contributed to the development of innovative products. Before my time there, I also held a position as a financial data consultant, collaborating with institutions in both London and Madrid.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
