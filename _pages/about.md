Hello. I am Duncan Cassells, and currently pursuing a PhD in Computational Social Science at Sorbonne Université, where I am also privileged to be an invitee at Sciences Po and LPI Cité Université in Paris.

My academic journey began in Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol, where I completed both my master's and undergraduate degrees. During these studies, I spent a year in the Mathematics and Computer Science departments at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, focusing on stochastic processes, complex networks, and artificial intelligence.

My research interests lie at the intersection of network science, mathematical modeling, and media expertise. I am particularly focused on investigating questions related to political polarization within social platforms, and the influence of group identity. By leveraging interdisciplinary approaches, I aim to gain insights into the dynamics and mechanisms that contribute to the creation and fragmentation of online communities.

Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I had the privilege of working as a senior data analyst for The Guardian, in London. In this role, I created insights to inform editorial strategies and contributed to the development of innovative products. Before my time at The Guardian, I also held a position as a financial data consultant, collaborating with institutions in both London and Madrid.

I am excited to share my academic journey, research findings, and insights with you through this web page. Please feel free to explore further and reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
